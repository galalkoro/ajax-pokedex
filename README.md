## what is pokedex
The Pokedex is an item found in every Pokemon game that records all Pokemon you have seen and captured while on your adventure. This page contains a list of every Pokemon in Sword and Shield and every Pokemon Location.

## The Pokedex API
The Pokedex API provides data about each of the 151 Pokemon, including moves, type, and weakness. Each type of query produces output in plain text or JSON format (You can test queries by typing in their URL in your browser's address bar and seeing the result).
